<p>I climb the world, as it is my will,</p>

<p>We want liberty.</p>

<p>Slowly the mind eats itself,</p>

<p>Dying inside, within</p>

<p>I climb the world, as it is my will,</p>

<p>Dress, eyes forlorn,</p>

<p>In the city nights</p>

<p>In the city nights</p>

<p>That have returned to</p>

<p>We want liberty.</p>

<p>Slowly the mind eats itself,</p>

<p>Beneath the damp leaf,</p>

<p>That have returned to</p>

<p>Beneath the damp leaf,</p>

<p>In the city nights</p>
