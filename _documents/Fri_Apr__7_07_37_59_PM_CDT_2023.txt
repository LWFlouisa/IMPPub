<p>Between hills and forests,</p>

<p>Flowing; her eyes forlorn,
Slowly I must go poof.
I seek the cold water, down river
I seek the cold water, down river</p>

<p>We want liberty.
Slowly I must go poof.</p>

<p>Flowing; her eyes forlorn,</p>

<p>Slowly I must go poof.
The glass shall revert to grass.
I seek the cold water, down river</p>
